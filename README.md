# üéß Spotify Churn Prediction & Engagement Analysis (2025)

## üåü Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data transformation to understand user engagement patterns and customer churn for a simulated Spotify dataset. The analysis was initially performed using Google Sheets and is now documented and stored here on GitHub.

The primary objective is to identify key factors leading to customer cancellations and provide actionable insights to help Spotify reduce its churn rate.

## üéØ Key Objectives

1.  **Data Transformation:** Clean and structure the raw dataset for analysis.
2.  **Dashboard Creation:** Develop a data visualization dashboard (initially in Google Sheets) to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and churn drivers.
3.  **Result Analysis:** Analyze engagement metrics, subscription types, and device usage to pinpoint high-risk user segments.
